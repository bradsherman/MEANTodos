# Project4MEANtodos

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.6.

This project is a simple Todos application that I built to learn more about MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node. It is based off of a course taught by [Brad Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA).

This application assumes you have a mongodb instance running on port 27017, and that you have node and npm installed.

To start the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/bradsherman/MEANTodos.git
cd ./MEANTodos
npm install
ng build
node server.js
```
